# Simple-Snake-Game
This is a basic implementation of the classic Snake game using Python. The goal of the game is to control the snake, make it grow by eating food, and avoid hitting the walls or itself.
Features
Arrow key controls: Use the arrow keys to guide the snake in different directions (up, down, left, right).
Randomized food spawning: Food appears in random locations on the grid, which the snake needs to collect.
Score tracking: Your score increases as the snake eats more food.
Game over screen: A "Game Over" message is displayed when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries required (uses built-in tkinter module)

How to Play
Clone the repository: Use the arrow keys to control the snake. Your score will be displayed at the top of the window. Try to eat as much food as possible without hitting the walls or your own body!
